# Parallel_K-Means_Using_Spark
An implementation of a parallel version of K-means clustering algorithm using the Spark map-reduce framework.

## Description
In this assignment, you are asked to implement a new parallel version of K-means clustering algorithm using the Spark map-reduce framework.

## Specifications
You should implement a parallel version of the K-Means algorithm using the MapReduce framework. Then, evaluate your clustering algorithm using the IRIS dataset as compared to the original one. In terms of run time and clustering accuracy.
Implement your algorithm in a generalized way (i.e can accept different sizes of feature vector).
